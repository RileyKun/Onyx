# Onyx
A fork of RPM focused on streamlining VRChat content creation without leaving the engine whatsoever.

## What is Onyx?
Onyx is a fork of RPM focused on streamlining and optimizing VRChat content creation. The end goal is to have a tool that allows you to do as many things as possible without leaving the engine what so ever.

## How to contribute?
Contribution is done via cloning the repository using a git client of your choice. How you implement the source as a package is on you. Format all of your code using the clang-format standard provided in the repository (when it is committed).

For general code guidelines:

 - Follow Hungarian Notation. This will make the codebase easier to follow through for people who do not have advanced IDEs but are wanting to make contributions anyways.
 - Mark TODOs, important comments, FIXMEs, etc. with your name. This enforces code responsibility and directs people to the right person with questions on how to contribute to their code.
 - Try to benchmark/profile your code as much as possible. Unity is already known for poor performance and we should not make it worse with our own code.

## How to download?
Download from GitHub releases (coming soon), or clone the code yourself and add yourself.
